## Hey I'm Alex
### A software developer and solution seeker
I work for moments of clarity after solving the last piece of a challenging problem. I live on the west coast of Canada in Vancouver where I enjoy the outdoors and all it has to offer; I try to make time on the weekends to ski, hike and bike. I studied Cognitive Systems for five years at the University of British Columbia which was a mixture of Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy and Psychology. I'm proud to say I've graduated into the tech field where I spend my day to day as a software developer. 

## IAM
- A software developer with years of experience in the fast-paced startup ecosystem, primarily focusing on SaaS companies. My expertise lies in building scalable web applications using Java, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. My roles have often required me to wear many hats.
- A graduate of the University of British Columbia (Aug 2020), where I completed a BA in Cognitive Systems.
  - Cognitive Systems (COGS) is a multi-disciplinary undergraduate program at UBC involving four departments: Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology.
  - The program provides students with a grounding in the principles and techniques used by intelligent systems both natural and artificial. It emphasizes the study of existing systems (e.g., perception; linguistics), the design of new ones (e.g., machine vision; machine intelligence), and the design of interfaces between different forms of intelligent agents (e.g., human-computer interfaces).
- Currently employed as a Full Stack Developer at [BC Public Service](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bc-public-service/), where I:
  - Contribute to building scalable software solutions for the Ministry of Education and Child Care to serve students and staff across 1,950 schools in British Columbia.
  - Utilize a diverse tech stack to meet the dynamic needs of public service projects, including:
    - **Java**: For robust backend development.
    - **Spring Boot**: Developing comprehensive enterprise-level applications.
    - **PostgreSQL & OracleDB**: Managing data in powerful and reliable database systems.
    - **Docker**: Containerizing applications to ensure consistency and efficiency.
    - **OpenShift**: Orchestrating containerized applications for scalability and reliability.
    - **Node.js**: For efficient server-side scripting to build scalable and high-performance web applications.
    - **JavaScript, Vue.js, & TypeScript**: Crafting dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
    - **Cypress**: Implementing end-to-end testing to assure application quality and reliability.
