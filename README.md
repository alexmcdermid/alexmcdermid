## Hey I'm Alex
### A software developer and solution seeker
I work for moments of clarity after solving the last piece of a challenging problem. I live on the west coast of Canada in Vancouver where I enjoy the outdoors and all it has to offer; I try to make time on the weekends to ski, hike and bike. I studied Cognitive Systems for 5 years at the University of British Columbia which was a mixture of Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy and Psychology. I'm proud to say I've graduated into the tech field where I spend my day to day as a software developer. 

## IAM
- A software developer with years of experience in the fast-paced startup ecosystem, primarily focusing on SaaS companies. My expertise lies in building scalable web applications using Ruby, Python, and JavaScript, but my role often requires me to be a jack-of-all-trades.
- A graduate of the University of British Columbia (Aug 2020), where I completed a BA in Cognitive Systems.
- Currently employed as a Full Stack Developer at [BC Public Service](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bc-public-service/), where I:
  - Contribute to building scalable software solutions for the Ministry of Education to serve students and staff across 1,950 schools in British Columbia.
  - Utilize a diverse tech stack to meet the dynamic needs of public service projects, including:
    - **Java**: For robust backend development.
    - **Docker**: Containerizing applications to ensure consistency and efficiency.
    - **PostgreSQL & OracleDB**: Managing data in powerful and reliable database systems.
    - **OpenShift**: Orchestrating containerized applications for scalability and reliability.
    - **Spring Framework**: Developing comprehensive enterprise-level applications.
    - **JavaScript, Vue.js, & TypeScript**: Crafting dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
    - **Cypress**: Implementing end-to-end testing to assure application quality and reliability.
    - **TestCafe**: For automated web testing to ensure seamless user experiences.

## Q&A
- Questions that I'm seeking answers for
    - What does it take to achieve the 'Senior' title?
- What energizes me?
    - Coffee... lots of coffee. But on a more serious note, problems to tackle energize my mind and gets me thinking.
- What depletes my energy?
    - Too many meetings, with the root cause being too much admin overhead, i.e. too many hoops to jump through. Often it can be necessary, but can often feel restrictive and draining.
- When am I most productive?
    - Usually during the morning hours, this must mean I'm fairly lucky as a West Coaster living in a East Coasters world.
- Some pet peeves
    - Distracting noises that aren't easily ignored.
    - Poorly documented tickets or inadequate documentation.
- If you read all the way
    - I try to spend a large portion of my free time outside, but I also spend a equally large portion of my free time playing video games. Usually I pick one and get really into it, if you are interested in knowing which one I play now, ask me!
