## Hey I'm Alex
### A software developer and solution seeker
I work for moments of clarity after solving the last piece of a challenging problem. I live on the west coast of Canada in Vancouver where I enjoy the outdoors and all it has to offer; I try to make time on the weekends to ski, hike and bike. Up until recently I would have called myself a student, I studied Cognitive Systems for 5 years at the University of British Columbia which was a mixture of Computer Science, Psychology, Philosphy and Linguistics. I'm proud to say I've fallen into the tech field where I spend my day to day as a software developer. 

## IAM
- A graduate of the University of British Columbia (Aug 2020), where I completed a BA in Cognitive Systems.
- A software developer with 2+ years experience in the startup industry working with multiple companies. The majority of my experience is in web applications using Ruby, Python and Javascript. I do however have quite a breadth of knowledge, as a unwritten requirement to working at startups is often having to wear many hats.
- Currently working full time as a web developer for [Harled Inc.](https://github.com/harled), where we specialize in Ruby on Rails web applications.

## Q&A
- Questions that I'm seeking answers for
    - What does it take to achieve the 'Senior' title?
    - Why Ruby on Rails over a more widespread webstack like MEAN or MERN?
- What energizes me?
    - Coffee... lots of coffee. But on a more serious note, problems to tackle energize my mind and gets me thinking.
- What depletes your energy?
    - Too many meetings, with the root cause being too much admin overhead, i.e. too many hoops to jump through. Often it is necessary but, can often feel restrictive and draining.
- When am I most productive?
    - Usually during the morning hours, this must mean I'm fairly lucky as a West Coaster living in a East Coasters world.
- Some pet peeves
    - Distracting noises that aren't easily ignored.
    - Poorly documented tickets or inadequate documentation.
    - Redundant meetings.
- If you read all the way
    - I try to spend a large portion of my free time outside, but I also spend a equally large portion of my free time playing video games. Usually I pick one and get really into it, if you are interested in knowing which one I play now, ask me!
