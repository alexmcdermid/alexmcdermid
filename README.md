## Hey I'm Alex
### A software developer and solution seeker
I work for moments of clarity after solving the last piece of a challenging problem. I live on the west coast of Canada in Vancouver where I enjoy the outdoors and all it has to offer; I try to make time on the weekends to ski, hike and bike. Up until recently I would have called myself a student, I studied Cognitive Systems for 5 years at the University of British Columbia which was a mixture of Computer Science, Psychology, Philosphy and Linguistics. I'm proud to say I've fallen into the tech field and spend my day to day as a junior software developer. 

## IAM
- Me now

- If you read all the way
    - I try to spend a large portion of my free time outside, but I also spend a equally large portion of my free time playing video games. Usually I pick one and get really into it, if you are interested in knowing which one I play now, ask me!
